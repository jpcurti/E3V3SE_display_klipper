# Reverse engineering the printer communication with display

The Creality Ender 3 V3 SE printer uses a display from TJC ([Taojin Chi](https://www.tjc1688.com/)) with model nr. **TJC3224T132_011N_P04**. This was confirmed by searching the manufacturer website for similar products, like the [TJC3224T132_011N_A01](https://www.tjc1688.com/contents/7/136.html):

Searching for information on chinese electronics is a challenge, but it looks like the creality display is a customer version of the generic display which adds the buttons and a buzzer. More information such as libraries or instruction set could not be found, so that the only way to check the communication protocol is to spoof the uart between printer and display. To do so, a usb-uart converter was used, as shown:

Most displays, including this, communicate at 115200 baud per default. When turning the printer, the following messages were sent by the printer to the display:

```hex
AA 00 CC 33 C3 3C
```

With that and a little bit of google, a [document that describes the instruction set of another display with similar protocol](https://www.dwin-global.com/uploads/T5L_TA-Instruction-Set-Development-Guide.pdf) was found. By logging the communication during navigation on the menu it was confirmed that most of the instructions are the same (if not all):

After that, it is a only a matter of listening to the communication while using the printer and understand how it works. This can be done by repeating the same commands as the printer sent via the computer in the following configuration:

Note that the screen is still being powered by the printer. You can replace this by another 5V source, but (usually) not directly from the USB Serial converter, as it can't provide enough current to the display. 

 For example, the messages that the printer sends to the display when booting is:

```py

AA 3D CC 33 C3 3C
# Drawing "creality" bootscreen is a sequence of commands

# Differences in the instruction set:

Unfortunately the instruction set found is only similar, but no the same as the one from the display. Some of the instructions does not work (QR, move page, and so on) and we need to double check how the original firmware does it, again by plugging our serial man in the middle and checking what happens, like in:

```lua
--end of screen, here the magic should happen:
AA 09 82 00 24 08 41 00 0B 00 19 00 EF 00 F0 CC 33 C3 3C -- This is the command that moves a part of the screen
-- What happens here? letÂ´s break it down:
AA: header
09: cut screen command
82: ? Probably a mode 80 | direction? 0x02 is top, 0x03 is down. Where is left and right?
0024: Y offset (36)
0841: no idea, is a background color
000B: X0 (11)
0019: Y0 (25)
00EF: X1 (239)
00F0: Y1 (240)

```

We can confirm it by changing x0,y0,x1,y1 and checking the screen. The same for the other unknown parameters.
Changing 0x82 for 0x81 doesnt move the screen, but to 0x83 makes it move down! Is this a custom command?
